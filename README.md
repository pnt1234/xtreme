# Prediction and Characterization of Extreme Events in Spatio-Temporal Data

This repository contains various datasets and software implemented as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of this project is to develop novel algorithms for predicting and characterizing extreme events in large-scale spatio-temporal data.
