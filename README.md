# xTreMe: Prediction and Characterization of Extreme Events in Spatio-Temporal Data

This repository contains various datasets and software implemented as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of this project is to develop novel algorithms for predicting and characterizing extreme events in large-scale spatio-temporal data. For more information, please visit the [**project website**](http://cse.msu.edu/~ptan/project/xtreme/).

## List of Software:

* [SELF-RECOVER](https://github.com/galib19/Self-Recover): This repository contains the python implementation for  forecasting extreme values from multiple time series with missing values.
* [DEMM](https://github.com/ampersandmcd/DeepExtremeMixtureModel): This repository contains the python implementation of a deep learning-based hurdle model with extreme value theory to enable point and distribution prediction of zero-inflated, heavy-tailed spatiotemporal variables.   
* [JOHAN](https://github.com/cqwangding/JOHAN#johan-a-joint-online-hurricane-trajectory-and-intensity-forecasting-framework)[1]: This repository contains the Matlab implementation of the JOHAN Algorithm for joint hurricane trajectory and intensity forecasting.
* [RCA](https://github.com/illidanlab/RCA)[2]: This repository contains the official python implementation of the Robust Collaborative Autoencoders(RCA) algorithm for anomaly detection.
* [PRL]()[3]: This repository contains the official implementation of the PRL algorithm for learning deep neural networks under agnostic corrupted supervision.
